- [Create More Than You Consume if You Want to Worry Less and Feel More Fulfilled](https://www.omaritani.com/blog/create-more-consume-less):
    - Too much consumption leads to a life of escapism.
    - Pleasurable experiences are rooted in consumption. Enjoyable experiences are rooted in creation.
    - Tip the scale toward creation:
        1. Choose something you enjoy.
        2. Block time for it, show up to it and say “no” to protect it.
        3. Leave your judgment at the door and replace it with self-compassion.
    - Create more, consume less. That’s a good mantra to live by.
